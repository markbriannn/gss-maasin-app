# Limitations of the Study

The General Service System is limited to operation within Maasin City, Southern Leyte, and the results of the study may not be directly applicable to other locations with different social, economic, or technological conditions.

The online payment feature is integrated with PayMongo payment gateway, supporting GCash and credit/debit card transactions. The system does not support cross-border transactions or multiple international payment gateways. While the system automatically adds a platform service fee (5%) to the client's payment, it does not generate official government tax documents or perform automated tax reporting.

The platform is designed to support short-term or sideline service engagements only and does not accommodate long-term employment arrangements, payroll systems, or contractual workforce management. The system includes in-app text messaging for coordination between clients and providers, but built-in real-time voice or video call features are not included.

System performance may be affected by the availability and stability of internet connectivity within the area. Real-time GPS tracking and push notifications require consistent internet access to function properly. In addition, the evaluation of the system is limited to the number of participants involved in usability testing and may not fully represent the perspectives of all potential users.

Security mechanisms implemented in the system include:
- Firebase Authentication for user login
- Firestore security rules for data access control
- Admin verification of provider documents
- Secure payment processing via PayMongo

However, advanced security features such as biometric authentication, two-factor authentication (2FA), or automated fraud detection are not included within the scope of this study.

The document verification process relies on manual admin review of submitted documents (ID, Barangay Clearance, Police Clearance) and does not include integration with government databases for automatic verification.

The research also does not examine the long-term economic, legal, or regulatory impact of the platform on stakeholders. The system is intended as a capstone project demonstration and may require additional features and compliance measures for full commercial deployment.
