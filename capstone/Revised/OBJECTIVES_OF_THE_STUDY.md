# Objectives of the Study

The main objective of this project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly web-based and mobile system called General Service System that will streamline the process of hiring and providing sideline services for both workers and clients in Maasin City.

Specifically, it aims to:

1. Design and develop the General Service System which will be capable of:

   a. registering service workers with valid government-issued identification, a selfie with ID, Barangay Clearance, Police Clearance, profile photo, and personal information to ensure safety and legitimacy.

   b. allowing users to create accounts using basic information with email and phone verification, and log in easily.

   c. enabling users to browse service categories, view provider profiles with ratings and reviews, and hire workers directly based on skills, availability, and distance.

   d. implementing an admin approval workflow where booking requests are reviewed before being sent to providers.

   e. giving workers the option to accept or reject job requests with real-time push notifications.

   f. providing real-time GPS tracking and navigation for accepted jobs, allowing clients to monitor provider location and estimated arrival time.

   g. enabling in-app messaging between clients and providers for coordination.

   h. tracking job progress through status updates (Pending → Accepted → Traveling → Arrived → In Progress → Completed).

   i. allowing workers to mark jobs as completed and generate digital receipts.

   j. enabling users to leave 5-star ratings and written reviews after the service.

   k. processing payments through cash or online payment methods (GCash, Cards) via PayMongo integration.

   l. implementing a platform service fee system where a percentage is added to the client's payment as system revenue.

2. Evaluate the General Service System in terms of usability, efficiency, functionality, and reliability based on ISO 9126 software quality standards.

3. Prepare a deployment and implementation plan that ensures the effective use of the system within Maasin City's service-based community.
