# Recommendations

Based on the findings of the study and the evaluation results of the General Service System (GSS), the following recommendations are proposed to further improve the system and to guide future research, development, and implementation.

## 1. System Enhancement and Feature Expansion

Future developers are encouraged to enhance the system by adding features that can further improve usability and overall functionality. The current implementation already includes in-app messaging, push notifications, and online payment integration. Recommended additional features include:

- **Voice/Video Calling** - Integration of real-time voice or video call features to allow direct communication between clients and service providers for complex service discussions
- **Service Scheduling Calendar** - A calendar-based booking system that allows clients to schedule services in advance and providers to manage their availability more effectively
- **Service History Analytics** - Detailed analytics for providers showing their performance trends, peak booking times, and earnings patterns
- **Favorite Providers List** - Enhanced functionality allowing clients to save and quickly access their preferred service providers
- **Service Package Bundles** - Allow providers to offer bundled services at discounted rates

Additional payment options may also be considered, such as bank transfers and other e-wallet platforms beyond GCash, to provide users with more flexible and convenient transaction methods.

## 2. Improved Security and Verification Mechanisms

Although the existing verification process effectively promotes trust between users through document submission (ID, Selfie with ID, Barangay Clearance, Police Clearance) and admin review, future versions of the system may benefit from stronger security measures:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** - Additional security layer for user login using SMS or authenticator apps
- **Biometric Verification** - Fingerprint or facial recognition for mobile app authentication
- **Automated Fraud Detection** - Machine learning-based systems to detect suspicious activities and fraudulent accounts
- **Document Verification API** - Integration with government databases for automated document authenticity verification
- **End-to-End Encryption** - Enhanced encryption for in-app messaging and sensitive data transmission

Conducting regular security audits and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (such as the Philippine Data Privacy Act) are also recommended. These practices would help maintain system integrity and increase user confidence as the platform continues to grow.

## 3. Performance Optimization and Offline Support

To reduce the system's dependence on stable internet connectivity, future enhancements may focus on performance optimization techniques:

- **Data Caching** - Store frequently accessed data locally to reduce server requests and improve load times
- **Lightweight Interface Designs** - Optimize images and assets for faster loading on slower connections
- **Offline Request Queuing** - Allow users to queue job requests and messages that automatically sync when connectivity is restored
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Enhance the web application with PWA features for better offline functionality
- **Image Compression** - Automatic compression of uploaded images to reduce bandwidth usage

These improvements would allow users to continue performing basic system functions even during periods of weak or unstable internet access, especially in remote or underserved areas of Maasin City.

Additionally, scalability testing is recommended to ensure that the system can handle increased user traffic and transaction volume without performance degradation as the platform grows.

## 4. Expansion to Other Localities

Since the current implementation of the General Service System is limited to Maasin City, Southern Leyte, future researchers may consider adapting and deploying the system in other municipalities or provinces. Expansion considerations include:

- **Multi-Region Support** - Architecture modifications to support multiple service areas with region-specific providers
- **Localization Features** - Multilingual support (Cebuano, Tagalog, English) for broader accessibility
- **Region-Specific Service Categories** - Customizable service categories based on local needs and available skills
- **Local Payment Methods** - Integration with region-specific payment options and local banks
- **Comparative Studies** - Research examining the system's adaptability and effectiveness across various socio-economic environments

Expanding the system to different locations would allow for comparative studies and help refine the platform for diverse community needs.

## 5. Policy Integration and Institutional Collaboration

Future development efforts may explore partnerships with local government units (LGUs), barangay offices, and livelihood programs to strengthen the system's credibility and sustainability:

- **LGU Partnership** - Collaboration with Maasin City government for official endorsement and promotion
- **TESDA Integration** - Link with Technical Education and Skills Development Authority for skills certification verification
- **Barangay Coordination** - Partnership with barangay offices for community-based promotion and verification support
- **Livelihood Programs** - Integration with existing government livelihood and employment programs
- **Business Registration** - Assistance for providers in formalizing their services through business registration

Such collaborations may also contribute to broader community-based economic development by providing service providers with more consistent job opportunities and official recognition.

## 6. Long-Term Impact Assessment

Future studies are encouraged to conduct long-term or longitudinal research to evaluate the sustained economic and social impact of the system:

- **Income Stability Analysis** - Track provider earnings over extended periods to assess income improvement
- **Job Frequency Metrics** - Monitor the frequency and consistency of job opportunities for providers
- **User Satisfaction Trends** - Conduct periodic surveys to measure satisfaction changes over time
- **Economic Impact Study** - Assess the platform's contribution to local economic activity in Maasin City
- **Social Impact Evaluation** - Examine changes in employment patterns and community trust levels

Assessing these factors over an extended period would provide deeper insights into the system's effectiveness beyond its initial implementation.

## 7. Enhancement of User Training and Support

To further improve system adoption and effective use, future implementations may include:

- **Onboarding Tutorials** - Interactive walkthroughs for new users explaining key features and workflows
- **Help Center** - Comprehensive FAQ section and troubleshooting guides within the application
- **Video Tutorials** - Step-by-step video guides for common tasks like registration, booking, and payment
- **Community Training Sessions** - Barangay-level training programs for service providers and clients
- **Digital Literacy Programs** - Basic smartphone and internet usage training for users with limited technical experience
- **In-App Support Chat** - Real-time customer support for immediate assistance with system issues

Providing technical support and digital literacy programs can help users, especially those with limited technological experience, fully utilize the system's features.

## 8. Software Quality Model Extension

While this study used the ISO/IEC 9126 software quality model for system evaluation, future research may adopt the updated ISO/IEC 25010 model. This newer framework provides a more comprehensive assessment of software quality by including additional attributes:

- **Security** - Protection of information and data
- **Compatibility** - Ability to exchange information with other systems
- **Maintainability** - Ease of modification and updates
- **Portability** - Ability to transfer from one environment to another
- **Performance Efficiency** - Resource utilization and response times
- **Functional Suitability** - Degree to which functions meet stated needs

Adopting the ISO/IEC 25010 model would provide a more thorough evaluation framework for future system assessments.

## Recommendation Summary
