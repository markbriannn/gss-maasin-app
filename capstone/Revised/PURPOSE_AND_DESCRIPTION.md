# Purpose And Description

The General Service System (GSS) is a web-based and mobile platform designed to improve how sideline service jobs are managed and accessed in Maasin City, Southern Leyte. It addresses the needs of informal workers such as carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and cleaners by offering a modern, reliable, and accessible system that connects them directly to clients in need of their services.

The GSS includes the following features:

- Registration for service workers with ID verification, selfie with ID, Brgy Clearance, and Police Clearance

- Easy for users to sign up as a client seeking services.

- Search and hire functionality based on worker skills, availability, ratings, and distance.

- Job request acceptance/decline options for workers.

- Admin approval workflow for booking requests before provider assignment.

- Real-time job tracking and coordination with live GPS location.

- In-app messaging between clients and providers.

- Task completion tracking with status updates (Pending → Accepted → Traveling → Arrived → In Progress → Completed).

- User feedback and rating system with 5-star reviews.

- Platform service fee, where a 5% fee is added to the client's total payment as system revenue, ensuring providers receive their full service price.

- Online payment integration via PayMongo (GCash, Cards) and cash payment options.

- Push notifications for real-time updates on job status, messages, and bookings.

This project aims to bridge the gap in informal employment by leveraging digital solutions, enhancing efficiency, and improving livelihoods through accessible and organized job connections.
