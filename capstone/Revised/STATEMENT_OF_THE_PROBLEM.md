# Statement of the Problem

The main problem of the project is to develop a system that provides a more organized, accessible, and efficient way of connecting clients with service workers for sideline jobs in Maasin City, Southern Leyte.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. How to design and develop a web-based and mobile system called General Service System that will be capable of:

   a. allowing workers to register by submitting their basic personal information, a valid government-issued ID, a selfie with ID, Barangay Clearance, and Police Clearance for identity verification;

   b. enabling users (clients) to register using basic personal details with email and phone verification, and log in to the system easily;

   c. allowing users to browse service categories, view provider profiles with ratings and reviews, and hire workers directly based on their skills, availability, and distance;

   d. implementing an admin approval workflow where booking requests are reviewed before being assigned to providers;

   e. providing workers with the option to accept or decline job requests through real-time push notifications;

   f. enabling real-time GPS tracking and navigation for accepted jobs, allowing clients to monitor provider location and estimated arrival time;

   g. providing in-app messaging between clients and providers for coordination;

   h. tracking job progress through status updates (Pending → Accepted → Traveling → Arrived → In Progress → Completed);

   i. allowing workers to mark their task as "completed" once the service is finished and generate digital receipts;

   j. letting users provide feedback by rating (5-star system) and commenting on the completed service;

   k. processing payments through cash or online payment methods (GCash, Cards) via PayMongo integration;

   l. implementing a platform service fee system where a percentage is added to the client's payment as system revenue.

2. What is the level of acceptability and usability of the General Service System among its target users and service workers based on ISO 9126 software quality standards?

3. How can the General Service System (GSS) be deployed and implemented effectively in Maasin City to benefit both the service workers and clients?
